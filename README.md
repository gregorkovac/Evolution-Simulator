# evolution-simulator

**Disclaimer:** this project is still very much work in progress. I have programmed the creatures to have random genes, but there is no "evolution" happening yet.

## What is this project?
As the name suggests, it's a simple evolution simulator. I basically created this project to start learning neural nets. It runs one C++ and I'm using SDL2 for graphics.

## How to build and run
Compile using `make EvolutionSimulator`\
Run using `./src/EvolutionSimulator.out`
